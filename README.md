## About the Project

This is a web application backend to track the evolution of school students in the curriculum.

It is built with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/), and has been deployed to [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)

[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is the database employed to store the data.

## Description

There are six different models in the application:
- Classroom: The classrooms of the school
- Student: The students in the classroom
- Presentation Areas: The topics in the curriculum
- Presentation Subareas: The subareas in which the topics are divided
- Presentation: The exercises that belong to each Presentation Subarea
- Event: Each time that a student works in a presentation, an event is recorded with the score (from 0 to 3) obtained.

These are the methods available in each controller:
- Users:
   * create: To sign up a user in the backend( POST /users)
- User:
   * create: To log in a user in the backend (POST /oauth/token)
- Classrooms:
   * index: To retrieve a list with all the classrooms (GET /classrooms)
   * show: To retrieve a list with all the students that belong to one classroom (GET /classrooms/:id)
- Students:
   * index: To retrieve a list with all the students in the school (GET /students)
- Presentation Areas:
   * index: To retrieve a list with all the Presentation areas (GET /presentation_areas)
   * show: To retrieve a list with all the Presentation subareas that belong to one Presentation area (GET /presentation_areas/:id)
- Presentation Subareas:
   * index: To retrieve a list with all the Presentation subareas (GET /presentation_subareas)
   * show: To retrieve a list with all the Presentations that belong to one Presentation subarea (GET /presentation_subareas/:id)
- Events:
   * index: To retrieve a list with all the Events that belong to one classroom (GET /classrooms/:id/scores)
   * show: To retrieve a list with all the Events that belong to one student (GET /students/:id/scores)
